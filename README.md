Pandas-basics
=============

Pandas basics.

The basics of Pandas in python.
Pandas is  a open source and it is a high level data manipulation tool.
It is built in on the Numpy package and its key data structure is called dataframe.
To import pandas we usually import it with a shorter name since it's used as much:
import pandas as pd
Just like examples for intialization:
data={
    'live':[1,2,3,4],
    'life':[3,0,4,2]
    }
 deliver=pd.Dataframe(data)
 deliver
